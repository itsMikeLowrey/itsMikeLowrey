<p>
  I currently work at <a href="https://www.resilientstrategiesllc.com/">Resilient Strategies LLC</a> as a Movement Technology Engineer 👨‍💻, supporting 60+ 501(c)(3)'s with software-based products and solutions.

  As a child raised in the deep South, my grandmother often told me, "Do the Right Thing," as a farewell message. I aim to do work that honors that ethos.
