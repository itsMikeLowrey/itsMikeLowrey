<h1 align="left">My name is Donely, and I am a Mission-Driven Engineer 👨‍🔧</h1>

<p>
  I currently work at <a href="https://www.resilientstrategiesllc.com/">Resilient Strategies LLC</a> as a Movement Technology Engineer, supporting 60+ NGOs with software-based products and solutions.

<p>
  I also created and run the world's most private e-commerce experience, <a href="https://anonshop.app/">AnonShop</a>.

  As a child raised in the deep South, my grandmother often told me, "Do the Right Thing," as a farewell message. I aim to do work that honors that ethos.
